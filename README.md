I'm 100% gaurranteed to not be Nyela K. But since I am great at inpersonating her, this is some of the data I've gathered...

üíª A README Definitely NOT done by Nyela K üíª <br>
######################################

# School:
Nyela K is an Engineering Physics student from the University of Alberta
- Eng Phys is an insane program with so many learning expectations and outcomes
- Coding is not required learning, but in many of the classes it has become main-stream to use python, or MATLAB for the complicated math and data analysis

# Developer
Nyela K has slowly been ticking off languages in the full-stack curriculum. A long history of C++ coupled with a research term using ROS and linux has turned her into a coding machine that absolutely hates code without comments. In 2024 she is building the front end of a few websites, of which a few tools will show up here! So cool to steal from people you inpersonate (she gave me permission)!!! 

Here are some other notes I found on her desktop while she wasn't looking üëÄ:
- Re-learning python fundamentals from the ground up
- Playing around with modding to learn random engine languages
- Picking up tkinter for some serious user friendly programming
- Frequently debating whether she should just use Linux full time
- Checkikng out Assembly based languages in her free time (not a lot of that right now)
- Limit testing html

# Current Projects 
Nyela K (who I am not) is looking to continue working on these projects:

## Verifire üî•üöí
As a backend developer of Verifire, Nyela K is expanding the "municipality_puller" framework. It's a project that uses wikipedia to scan for low level government websites and consolidates the information into a feed that can be parsed by other functions. The purpose for this is to enhance Verifire's backend by providing region based updates during natural disasters and evacuations - something that currently doesn't have widespread media foundations. Hopefully Verifire can one day be used to automatically conglomerate all low level government updates to citizens. 

## Spellviewer + ‚ú®üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ú®
A very quiet project exists out there in the world called "spellviewer", something that Nyela K and her friends use quite prolifically. It however was not developed by Nyela K, and has since stopped development. Nyela K appears to want to revise this program by creating a much more in depth 5th edition spell backend.

## Hackathonifier üñ≤Ô∏è(I'm sorry, Dave.)
There are THOUSANDS of hackathons out there in the worldwideweb - Hackathonifier is a project in the planning stage. It looks like this: scan for past hackathon topics, create a feed and database for the topics, and allow the app users to select past hackathon prompts to attempt, and allowing them to customize their project timeline. After completing the prompt, they will be presented with the actual winners of the hackathon and can see what other groups did to compare. This would act as a huge learning resource for people relatively good with coding, but lacking projects to actually attempt. 

## Dyslexia Extension üìñ
While developers can view dyslexic-accesible-html, the best way to help dyslexic web viewers is to add support to the programs they use. A dyslexia chrome extension would use similar features to dyslexic-accesible-html and provide users with options to better format web pages to aid their reading difficulties.
